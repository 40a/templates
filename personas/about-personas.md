# The Personas Article

## What are personas or proto-personas?

A persona is essentially a model that represents a large group of similar users, similar to a stereotype in social sciences. However, unlike stereotypes that are based on racial generalities, true personas are expected to be based on ethnographic research, user interviews, and user observation.

A Proto-Persona (or Ad-Hoc Persona) is a persona that is created using a project stakeholder’s intuition and anecdotal evidence (“ad-hoc” meaning improvised or impromptu).
